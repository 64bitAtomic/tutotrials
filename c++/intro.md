# Introduction to C++

## What is C++?

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that builds on the foundation of C. It is widely used for developing operating systems, game engines, real-time systems, and more.

## Features of C++

- **Object-Oriented**: Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **High Performance**: Allows low-level memory manipulation.
- **Multi-Paradigm**: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.
- **Standard Library**: Includes a vast collection of functions and data structures.

## Why Learn C++?

- Used in game development, system programming, and high-performance applications.
- Provides fine-grained control over system resources.
- A stepping stone for learning other languages like C, Java, and C#.

## Writing Your First C++ Program

A simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!":

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `#include <iostream>`: Includes the standard input-output stream library.
- `using namespace std;`: Allows usage of standard C++ functions without prefixing `std::`.
- `int main()`: Main function where execution starts.
- `cout << "Hello, World!";`: Outputs text to the console.
- `return 0;`: Indicates successful program execution.

## C++ File Extension

C++ source files use `.cpp` as their file extension.

## Summary

- C++ is a powerful and efficient programming language.
- It supports multiple programming paradigms.
- Writing and running a basic C++ program is straightforward.
