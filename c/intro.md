# Introduction to C

## What is C?

C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development.

## Features of C

- **Fast and Efficient**: C provides low-level memory access and minimal runtime overhead.
- **Portable**: C programs can run on different platforms with minimal modifications.
- **Structured Language**: Supports functions and modular programming.
- **Rich Library Support**: Includes standard libraries for input/output, string handling, and more.
- **Widely Used**: Forms the foundation of many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python.

## Why Learn C?

- **Foundation of Programming**: Learning C helps in understanding memory management and system architecture.
- **Used in OS Development**: Many operating systems, including Linux and Windows, are written in C.
- **Embedded Systems**: C is the go-to language for hardware programming.

## Writing Your First C Program

A simple C program that prints "Hello, World!":

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `#include <stdio.h>`: Includes the standard input-output library.
- `int main() { ... }`: Defines the main function where execution begins.
- `printf("Hello, World!\n");`: Prints text to the console.
- `return 0;`: Signals successful execution.

## C File Extension

C source files use the `.c` extension.

## Summary

- C is a fast and efficient language used in system programming.
- It provides low-level memory control and portability.
- Writing and executing a basic C program is straightforward.
